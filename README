# Home Server

Home Server is a project that allows users to set up a local network server that acts like a micro social media, where users can follow, message and share files with each other.

## Getting Started

If you've ever accessed the command line, you'll find this pretty trivial. We'll go through installing and setting-up all of the necessary components to get the server up and running.

### Prerequisites

In order to host *Home Server*, you'll need to install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/). All of the other tools will be installed through *Python* and its package installer, *pip*.

### Installing

Getting Home Server to start isn't all that hard. As long as you follow the commands, you'll get it running in no time! Clone the repository and extract it to a desired location. Then, fire up the command line on the *home_server* directory.

Follow the steps below on your command line to set-up the environment.

#### For Windows

\#1: Setting up the environment

```python
py -m venv env
```

\#2: Activating the environment:

```python
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

\#3: Installing the required packages:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

\#4: Generating the *home_server* database:

```python
flask db upgrade
```

\#5: Running the server:

```python
flask run
```

#### For macOS and Linux

\#1: Setting up the environment

```python
python3 -m venv env
```

\#2: Activating the environment:

```python
source env/bin/activate
```

\#3: Installing the required packages:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

\#4: Generating the *home_server* database:

```python
flask db upgrade
```

\#5: Running the server:

```python
flask run --host=0.0.0.0
```

With the server set-up and visible in your home network, navigate to *localhost:5000* on your web browser. From there, you should be able to register, login and user the **Home Server** app.
